**Stay Awake** is a simple yet powerful web application designed to prevent your device's screen from automatically going into sleep mode. It's perfect for situations where you need your screen to remain active, such as reading long articles, monitoring dashboards, or giving a presentation.

Beyond its core functionality as a web app, Stay Awake is also available as a **Browser Extension**, offering a more powerful and persistent way to keep your screen on without needing to keep a tab open.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Note:** The app relies on the Screen Wake Lock API or fallback methods, which require the browser tab to remain in the foreground to be effective.

Beyond its core functionality, Stay Awake provides several handy widgets to enhance your productivity:

- **‚è∞Digital Clock:** Keep track of the current time and date.
- **üîãBattery Status:** Monitor your device's battery level and charging status (requires browser support).
- **‚úÖTo-Do List:** Jot down quick tasks and manage them directly within the app.
- **üçÖPomodoro Timer:** Implement the Pomodoro Technique for focused work sessions and breaks.

The application saves your preferences (like widget visibility, positions, clock format) and To-Do list items locally in your browser. It's also installable as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for an app-like experience.
